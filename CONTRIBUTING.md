## Development Setup

See [README.md](./README.md#quick-start) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
cd api && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Start Redis
redis-server

# Start all services
npm run dev
```

## Code Style

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use functional components and hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Format with Prettier before committing

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Backend (Python)

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints (mypy)
- Use Pydantic for data validation
- Format with Ruff

```bash
cd api
ruff check .
ruff format .
mypy .
```

## Commit Message Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add new feature
fix: fix bug in X
docs: update documentation
style: format code
refactor: refactor component X
test: add tests for Y
chore: update dependencies
```

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes should include tests.

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend

# Unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test

# E2E tests (Playwright)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd api

# Run pytest
pytest -v

# With coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Update API.md if you add/change endpoints
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md for architectural changes

## Review Process

1. PRs require at least 1 approval
2. All CI checks must pass
3. Code must be formatted and linted
4. Tests must pass
5. No merge conflicts with `main`
